# Word-Guess-Game
A browser-based word guess game a la Hangman or Wheel of Fortune. The game takes an external .JSON dictionary file and from it selects a word to be guessed and displays the definition to help the user. The user then registers guesses by entering keys until they either reveal the word or lose after guessing wrong too many times.
